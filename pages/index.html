			<p><strong>What is it?</strong> The Open Source Security User Interface (OSSUI) Project is a free-to-use information security software solution based on the open source <a href="http://ossec.github.io">OSSEC</a> host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS). The focus of this project is to create a HIDS interface that anyone can use and to increase information security awareness. OSSUI features include: alert monitoring for your system, a user-friendly graphical user interface, simplified installation process, and <a href="services.html">more</a>.

			<p><strong>Why do I need it?</strong> In today's increasingly interconnected world, cyber-attacks present a real threat to businesses of any size. Cyber attacks can cost businesses thousands for dollars and damages and many companies are not equipped to defend against them. OSSUI is intended for small-businesses who may not have dedicated IT professionals. Therefore, it has been designed with ease-of-use in mind.
